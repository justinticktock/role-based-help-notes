Help Notes/Posts dedicated per role.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to quckly create a custom post type for user roles.  This allows users, with a specific role, the ability to create and edit their 'help notes' providing a private set of notes for use by members of the role.  It can be used for anything else that fits with that role (e.g. creating minutes-of-meetings notes etc...).
